# Cryptopals challenges

This repo should document the progress on the cryptopal crypto challenges found [here](https://cryptopals.com/).

The challenges assume little coding experience and are language-agnostic. I chose python because the idea of coding that stuff in C basically gives makes me nauseous... 

I'll organize by challenges. Right now, everything is in one file (cryptoHelper.py) but I might split it by cipher type going further.
